# SHEEPBRAIN

SHEEPBRAIN is currently an engine for playing the classic Wisconsin card game Sheepshead/Sheephead in python. The goal of this project is to create a neural network for classifying monte-carlo tree search nodes - this is in progress.

## Usage
all that's supported right now is running a completely random simulation:

    git clone https://github.com/CharliePalm/sheepbrain
    cd sheepbrain
    python3 simulation.py
